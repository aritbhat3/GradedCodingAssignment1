There is an inconsistency in the assignment sheet, in the program description, the return statement for HR_Dept class is "Fill today’s worksheet and mark your attendance" whereas the expected output says its supposed to be "Fill today’s timesheet and mark your attendance".

Ticket has been raised for the same on platform, no resolution as of yet, therefore have used the Program description statement and printed "Fill today’s worksheet and mark your attendance". 

If ticket is resolved within time frame, will update with final version of statement.
